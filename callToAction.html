    <h2>Lack of Sleep is Associated with Mental Health Issues</h2>
    <p>It is no question that sleep affects people's daily lives. Getting little sleep makes a person feel fatigued and less energetic throughout the day. </p>
    <p> Not getting the right amount of sleep affects not only your physical health, but also your mental health and abilities. Because of this, <strong>it is important that you get enough sleep each night to protect your overall well-being.</strong> </p>
    <p> These studies have shown that typically, females get less sleep on average than males and that females typically have a higher rate of having mental health issues than males.</p>

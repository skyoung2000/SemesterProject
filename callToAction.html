    <h2>Duration of Sleep is Linked to Mental Health in Different Ways for Boys and Girls</h2>
    <p>It is no question that sleep affects people's daily lives. Getting little sleep makes a person feel fatigued and less energetic throughout the day. </p>
    <p> Not getting the right amount of sleep affects not only your physical health, but also your mental health and abilities. Because of this, <strong>it is important that you get enough sleep each night to protect your overall well-being.</strong> </p>
    <p> This study that was published by BMC Public Health, where common mental disorders (CMDs) using the General Health Questionaire at the beginning of a 9-month period and a follow-up.</p>

    <p class = "byGraph">This information suggests that there is a <strong>link between amount of sleep and mental health,</strong> as there was only a minor change in CMD scores with adequate amounts of sleep, and great changes with short or long sleep for both genders. </p>
    <p class = "byGraph2">Also, note that the typical CMD scores for girls are typically lower than those for boys, showing that <strong>boys may have higher tendencies to have common mental disorders </strong>(though there is evidence that the opposite is true for adults).
    </p>
    <p class = byGraph3>
    Using this information, we can conclude that getting a different amount of sleep than what is recommended can lead to greater changes in mental health scores than getting an adequate amount of sleep.

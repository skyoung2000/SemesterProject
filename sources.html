<p>I got two of my sources from statista, from various datasets about sleep and mental health. Some are surveys put out by statista, while others are taken from the CDC or other health organizations (SAMHSA; NSDUH). My other source was from the BMC Public Health webpage, which I trust is a valid source.</p>

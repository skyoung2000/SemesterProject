<p>I got most of my sources from statista, from various datasets about sleep and mental health. Some are surveys put out by statista, while others are taken from the CDC or other health organizations (SAMHSA; NSDUH).</p>
    
<p> Each data set that I have found so far has been pretty simple, most of them just tallying the number of survey responses to a single question about sleep or mental health. My goal this week is to find more multi-demintional data so that I can make more interesting graphs.</p>

    <p> Sleep plays an important role in mental health. Not getting enough sleep leads to things like irritability and fatigue. It is important for both children and adults to get the right amount of sleep in order to be able to have good mental and physical health. I feel strongly about this topic because I think that the amount of sleep I get drastically affects how I feel day to day, and I am someone that needs a lot of sleep to function to my highest capabilities. There are many people that put sleep on the bottom of their priorities, but it affects so much that people should pay more attention.</p>

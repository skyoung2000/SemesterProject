    <h1>The Effects of Sleep on Mental Health and School Success</h1>
    <a href = "sources.html">sources</a>
    <p> My project will be about how the amount of sleep people get affects their everyday life in different ways. I would like to be able to link sleep patterns to  things like mental health and how students do in school. I chose this topic because although I don't study psychology, I have always found sleep interesting and know that it has major effects on many things in life.</p>
